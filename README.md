# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a basic guideline on how to create, debug, and deploy a website. This project is built in order to understand and learn how to communicate with the computer in order for it to execute tasks that will be implemented on the website being developed. Through the journey of making this guideline, I've learned to create content in HTML and CSS which will enable me to establish how the website will look like. I've learned to use JavaScript which enables users to interact with the content created in HTML and CSS.
